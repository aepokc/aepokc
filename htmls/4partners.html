aep's partners provide voluntary in-kind and monetary support to aep and allow the organization to sustain itself and grow at a faster rate.  
Our partners are all corporate citizens that actively support the community and provide valuable services to the community.  
Many of these partners are the foundation for our employment directory and cooperatively work with the Chamber and aep to recruit and retain professional talent.
