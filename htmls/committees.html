aep's committees are the lifeblood of the organization and the cogs that keep 
our organization moving forward. Members are encouraged to join a committee to 
learn more about the organization and to foster development of new ideas and 
create the critical mass necessary for the organization to remain a leading edge 
contributor within the community.<br /><br />
