aep hosts a number of civic, social and professional events throughout the year in Oklahoma City. 
Our social mixers have been held at the newest attractions in the city and continue to be a great place to meet new people. 
Our civic projects have included Habitat for Humanity, Big Brothers Big Sisters, food shelters and White Fields - a new local boys home. 
Our professional business meetings give aep members and guests insight into OKC's business and political leadership. 
Through our partnership with the Chamber, aep speaks at colleges throughout the state, job fairs, Greater Grads events and other Chamber functions. 
aep-sponsored leadership retreats are held in some the best venues in Oklahoma and are a great way to learn more about other new aep members.
