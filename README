aep is a dynamic organization of young people who share a passion to experience the best of Oklahoma City and the goal of creating a diverse and vibrant community with a superb quality of life. Founded in 2004 by half a dozen men and women in their mid-twenties, aep is now an organization with strong leadership, dedicated committees and a growing membership. The sole focus and driving passion of aep is to impact change in Oklahoma City's cultural and professional landscapes. We believe young professionals can be influential leaders and make a positive impact on the future of our city through community outreach and networking. We are the voice of the next generation of leaders. We bring together newcomers and locals, traditionalists and trendsetters, entrepreneurs and corporate â€” the best and brightest of OKC. aep is the best forum for young professionals to meet each other, experience the city, learn what's going on and make a difference for tomorrow.
